If we push ourselves to add lots of links between our notes, that makes us think expansively about what other concepts might be related to what we’re thinking about. It creates pressure to think carefully about how ideas relate to each other (see [[20250120215849|Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented]]). It’ll also help you internalize the ideas more deeply.
